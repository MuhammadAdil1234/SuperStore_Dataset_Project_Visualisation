# üìä Superstore Sales Analysis Project

This project analyzes the Superstore Sales Dataset to extract insights, perform data visualizations, and apply machine learning models for predictive analysis. It was developed as part of the final coursework for the module **Visualization for Data Analytics (CSC-40048)**.

## üîç Overview

The Superstore Sales dataset contains transactional data related to customer orders, including sales, profit, shipping details, and more. In this project, we:

- Cleaned and pre-processed the dataset
- Performed exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Engineered new features to enhance insight extraction
- Scaled and encoded data for machine learning
- Built models to classify profitable and non-profitable orders

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Removed null and duplicate entries
- Converted date columns and extracted time-based features (month, year, day)
- Created new feature: `shipping_duration`
- Transformed `sales` into float and generated `is_profitable` label
- Encoded categorical data using Label Encoding
- Normalized numerical features using MinMaxScaler
- Built classification models to predict profitability
- Visualized business trends and KPIs

üß∞ Technologies Used
Python 3.9

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab

üìà Machine Learning
We created a binary feature is_profitable and trained models to predict it using:

Label encoding for categorical values

MinMax scaling for numerical features

Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN.)
